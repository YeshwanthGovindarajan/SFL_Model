# Secure Federated Learning (SFL) System

## Project Overview

The Secure Federated Learning (SFL) system combines advanced federated learning techniques with the security and immutability of blockchain technology. This project aims to enable collaborative machine learning without centralizing data, thus preserving privacy and security while ensuring data integrity and traceability through Ethereum smart contracts.

### Key Features

- **Federated Learning Backend**: Implements a decentralized machine learning protocol where participants train models locally and share model updates.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Utilizes Ethereum blockchain to record and validate model updates, ensuring data integrity and non-repudiation.
- **Smart Contract for Model Management**: Manages the lifecycle of model updates using Ethereum smart contracts, including validation, aggregation, and benchmarking.
- **NFT-Based Authentication**: Leverages Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to authenticate and uniquely identify each participant in the network.
- **Digital Twins**: Employs digital twin technology to benchmark and validate the global model against previous states.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip and virtualenv
- Node.js 14.x
- npm or yarn
- Truffle Suite
- Ganache for a local Ethereum blockchain simulation

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourgithubusername/sfl-system.git
   cd sfl-system
   
1. Set Up Python Environment
   ```bash
   virtualenv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Install Node.js Dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install

3. Start Ganache
   ```bash
   ganache-cli

4. Deploy Smart Contracts
   ```bash
   truffle migrate --reset


### Usage
Hereâ€™s how you can start using the SFL system:

1. **Run Federated Learning Simulations**
   ```bash
   python run_federated_learning.py

2. **Interact with Smart Contracts via Truffle Console**
   ```bash
   truffle console

   const sfl = await SFLBlockchain.deployed();
   sfl.submitModelUpdate(...);

### Running the Tests
Ensure the system works as expected by running the tests provided:

1. **Python tests**
   ```bash
   python -m unittest discover -s tests

2. **Smart Contract Tests**
    ```bash
   truffle test
